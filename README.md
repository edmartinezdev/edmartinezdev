# Hello! üëã I'm Ed Martinez

With over 10 years in software engineering, I've built mobile and web applications, primarily using Swift, Ruby on Rails, Firebase, and more recently, I've been diving deeper into the React ecosystem and tools like Tailwind UI. Currently, I work on developing robust applications and seek to continuously sharpen my skills in modern web technologies.
